										</h1></p><strong>Dr. Semmelweis and the Importance of Handwashing</Strong>
										</p>I completed a data analysis project on Dr. Semmelweis’ discovery of handwashing and its impact on reducing maternal mortality. Using R and ggplot2, I explored historical hospital records to analyze how implementing handwashing influenced death rates.
										
										<p></p>Key tasks and insights from the project:
										<p></p>✔ Data Wrangling: Loaded and structured yearly and monthly mortality data from CSV files.
										<p></p>✔ Proportion of Deaths Analysis: Calculated the proportion of deaths per births for each year and month to observe trends.
										<p></p>✔ Visualization with ggplot2:
										
										Created a yearly line plot, distinguishing mortality trends between two clinics.
										Designed a monthly trend plot, adding a marker for when handwashing was introduced (June 1st, 1847).
										<p></p>✔ Impact of Handwashing:
										Added a handwashing_started column to categorize data before and after June 1847.
										Compared the mean proportion of deaths before and after handwashing, showing a significant decline in mortality rates.
										<p></p>This project reinforced my expertise in data visualization, statistical analysis, and storytelling with R, while also highlighting the power of data-driven decision-making in Public health.</h3>

											<h3><p>Data Quality Assurance (DQA) Expertise:</p>
												<p></p>Ensuring data accuracy, completeness, and reliability is a core part of my work in Public Health data management. I have been actively involved in Data Quality Assurance (DQA) exercises, working closely with stakeholders to strengthen data systems for evidence-based decision-making.
												
												<p></p>Key Areas of My DQA Work Include:
												<p></p>✔ Routine Data Quality Assessments (RDQA): Conducted systematic reviews of HIV program data, identifying gaps and ensuring compliance with reporting standards.
												<p></p>✔ Data Verification & Validation: Cross-checked reported data against source documents to improve data integrity and consistency.
												<p></p>✔ Capacity Building: Trained health facility staff on data management best practices, ensuring accurate data collection, entry, and reporting.
												<p></p>✔ Automated DQA Dashboards: Leveraged BI tools to develop real-time data quality tracking systems, providing insights into data discrepancies.
												<p></p>✔ Stakeholder Engagement: Worked with Government agencies, Donors, and Implementing partners to enhance data quality processes, ensuring alignment with National and Global reporting frameworks.
												
												<p>Through my DQA efforts, I have contributed to strengthening health information systems, leading to better program performance monitoring and improved Public Health outcomes.</p></h3>
